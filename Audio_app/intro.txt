Hello, This is a flutter music app. Where we can run audio through the assets and from the network as well. I used two package fluttertoast and audioplayers. 

Fluttertoast is to generate the toast on clicking the buttons and audioplayers to run our audio file. 

For designing the whole app Material app is used and to provide the canvas I used the Scaffold. Through the scaffold, I created the app bar and body part.

In order to put the multiple widgets inside the body, I used the column widget. For designing the player background I used the card property. First, I added the music through the internet and then in the next card I used assets file to play the music. 

## Future updates
I will add a navigation button and then we will also be able to integrate the video player on the next page. 
Loop playlist function will also be added and custom playlist functionality will also be implemented.
